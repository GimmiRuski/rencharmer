<h1 align="center">renCharmer</h1>

A utility script to work with python blocks in Ren'Py scripts.

The name is inspired by [kobaltcore](https://github.com/kobaltcore)'s Ren'Py tools.

## Disclaimer

**renCharmer** is still pretty early on in development, so be aware of that. I would strongly recommend against using it with projects that aren't tracked using a [version control system](https://git-scm.com/).

## Usage

```
$ python3 rencharmer.py -h
Usage: rencharmer.py [OPTIONS] SCRIPT

Options:
  -b, --black                Use black to format python blocks.
  -p, --print-python-blocks  Print the python blocks that are found.
  -h, --help                 Show this message and exit.
```
